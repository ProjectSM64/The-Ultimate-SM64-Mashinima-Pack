Install the program. Do not open!

If you are using 10 version, use Vegas Pro 12 Patch for Windows 8 file! It might work.

Extract the Patch RAR file

Go to the file location of Vegas 12 (Right click Vegas 12 application you installed, click Properties, click open file location) 

Drag Vegas Pro 12 Patch.exe file to the Vegas Pro 12.0 folder (depending on the windows version you're using).

Open the application, you'll get a pop up window of a woman, click patch. If you see OK, close the program and you're ready to use Vegas 12.


NOTE: If you get the End User License Agreement, just click Agree. This happens to me a lot of time. It still works. 
Enjoy the upgrade version of Sony Vegas. You now have acess to new features than Vegas 8! :) (Though I recommend buying the program
because piracy is bad...)
