CMTP is my new patching format that only contains character data.

You can patch it to any ROM that is 64MB in size, or the original 8MB ROM (no Decomp)

Mobile people at the date of writing still cannot use CMTP. Use BPS instead. Sorry!

If you want to use the CMTP, download the CometCHAR Patcher at

https://github.com/projectcomet64/CometCHAR/releases/latest

The BPS also has a chroma key room at stage 25 in Level Select which has a texture you can load with the video plugin to have any chroma color.
