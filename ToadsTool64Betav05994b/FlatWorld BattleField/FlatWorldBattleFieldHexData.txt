--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command that originally loads and jumps to Bob-Ombs Battlefield's Level commands bank
It's found at 0x2AC0F8

Original jump to Bob-Ombs Battlefield (BBB):
00 10 00 0E 00 40 5A 60 00 40 5F B0 0E 00 02 64

Changed to jump to FlatWorld Battlefield (FWB):
00 10 00 0E 01 20 00 00 01 20 11 B0 0E 00 00 D0

Explanation: Loads data in bank 0x0E, taken from 0x1200000 to 0x12011B0 in the ROM, then jumps to offset 0x0000D0 in bank 0x0E.

Note: A copy of this FlatWorld Battlefield 0x10 command is found at 0x11FFF00. This copy is used by TT64 to re-enable the FlatWorld level after it's disabled.
(Once the new level and polygon data is written the first time by TT64, switching between BBB and FWB is only a matter of swapping the load/jump commands. This is what TT64 does when enabling/disabling FWB.)
