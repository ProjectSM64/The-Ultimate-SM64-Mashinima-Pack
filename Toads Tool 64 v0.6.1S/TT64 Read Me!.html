  <font size="3">First I want to thank <strong>Guy Perfect</strong> (aka. <strong>BGNG</strong>) 
  for cracking the MIO0 compression format, because without him, TT64 wouldn't 
  exist. Big thanks also to <strong>Cellar Dweller</strong> for his precious help 
  on low-level n64 stuff and asm, <strong>Hyperhacker</strong> for starting <a href="http://acmlm.no-ip.org/archive2/thread.php?id=12971">the 
  original SM64 hacking thread</a> on the <a href="http://acmlm.no-ip.org/archive2/">old 
  acmlm board</a>. There are also many others from this era I'd like to thank 
  for their support and contributions, more importantly <strong>Chickenlump</strong>, 
  <strong>rstewart215804, Someguy</strong> and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Stag019</strong></font>. 
  If anyone feels left out, just contact me, I probably just forgot you :) Thanks 
  also to everyone leaving encouraging comments and bug reports on my blog!</font><font size="2"> 
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3">Lastly I want 
  to thank <strong>BooUrns</strong> for doing some private Beta testing.</font></font></font></p>

  <strong><font color="#EC1700" size="3">Please keep in mind that this is a Public 
  Beta program. It has bugs and issues. It shouldn't screw up your computer, but 
  I'm not responsible if it happens. </font></strong></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"></font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To use Toad's Tool 64, you 
  need to provide your own Super Mario 64 ROM file. <strong>This ROM file must 
  be &quot;Extended&quot; using the SM64 ROM Extender tool.</strong> What this 
  tool does is decompress data found inside the ROM and makes a new ROM that's 
  much more easy to edit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SM64 ROM Extender 1.2b 
  can be found at this address: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/qubedstudios/Mario64Tools.htm">http://homepage.mac.com/qubedstudios/Mario64Tools.htm</a></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After you click on the splash-screen, 
  the first thing that happens when you start TT64 is that you'll be asked to 
  open an Extended Super Mario 64 (US) ROM file. If you cancel or provide an unusable 
  ROM, the editor will send you to an error page, where you can try again by pressing 
  the Open ROM button.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If all goes well and you 
  open the right file, you'll get to see a progress bar on the top of the screen, 
  and various loading/decoding processes happening.<br>
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/TT64Screen1th.jpg" width="395" height="290"></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the ROM Loading phase 
  is over, the editor will load the &quot;Castle Ground&quot; level by default. 
  You'll be able to change this default level in the preference pane.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Note for Windows Vista 
  users: There is a possibility that you will see an error about permissions and 
  the file being in use when you try to open a ROM. This can be solved by right-clicking 
  on TT64's icon and choosing &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; from the context 
  menu. If you don't want to have to do this every time you run the program, you 
  can right-click on TT64's icon and choose Properties. In the Compatibility tab, 
  check the &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; box. <strong>Another thing to note 
  is that in Vista, hardware acceleration doesn't work in TT64 and the software 
  renderer will cause some objects to be displayed incorrectly. This should be 
  fixed when Adobe releases a Vista and intel-Mac version of Director MX later 
  this year.</strong></font></font></p>

  <strong>Open ROM...:</strong> Enables you to open another ROM for editing.<br>
  <strong>Save:</strong> To save changes to level data. Will turn red when any 
  changes are made.<br>
  <strong>Launch ROM:</strong> Will launch the currently opened ROM just like 
  you double-clicked the ROM file, presumably opening it in your favorite n64 
  emulator.<br>
  <strong>Edit Textures:</strong> Switches to the texture importer/exporter, where 
  you can also edit Mario's colors.<br>
  <strong>Preferences:</strong> Opens the preferences panel.<br>
  <strong>Quit:</strong> Use to quit the editor.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Refresh:</strong> Redraws the current level.<br>
  <strong>Course:</strong> Displays the current level name<br>
  <strong>Area:</strong> Displays all sub-areas in that level, clicking on a number 
  will load the appropriate area.<br>
  <strong>Acts:</strong> Click on a star to see only 0x24 objects found in this 
  particular act (star goal). Invisible objects will be grayed out the object 
  menu. You can use the shift key to select multiple acts to be displayed. Click 
  &quot;All&quot; to select all acts at once. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><strong><font size="3">Level 
  Menu:</font></strong></u></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/levelmenu.jpg" width="200" height="132"><br>
  If you want to load another level, at any time, click the white arrow on the 
  left of the &quot;Course:&quot; label. This will bring up the Level Selection 
  Menu.<br>
  <br>
  If you simply click on the name of the level, you'll load this particular level. 
  You can also jump to a particular sub-area by clicking a number that's on the 
  right of the level name.<br>
  <u><strong><font size="3"><br>
  </font></strong></u>  </font><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Camera 
  And View Controls:</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/camcontrols.jpg" width="507" height="21"><br>
  Front,Back, Top, Bottom, Left, Right buttons do what you expect them to do, 
  changing the camera view to see the top, front, back etc. of the level. In these 
  camera mode you'll be in &quot;Select Object&quot; mode, meaning that you can 
  left-click on the 3D view to select an object.<br>
  <br>
  The Follow Selection button enables you to have the selected object centered 
  in your view. If you select another object, the view will move accordingly. 
  If you deselect the &quot;Follow Selection&quot; feature manually, this particular 
  view will retain its position.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/camwidgets.jpg"> <br>
  <br>
  To move the camera manually you can use the &quot;<strong>Move Camera</strong>&quot; 
  widget.<br>
  <br>
  There are two modes for this widget. <strong>Relative</strong> and <strong>Absolute</strong>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In <strong>Relative</strong> mode, click and hold the mouse on the squarish 
  part of the widget. The camera will move left/right, up/down at a speed relative 
  to the distance between your cursor and the center of this square. The other 
  part of this widget, which is vertical, controls the movement forward and backward. 
  In the Relative mode, the camera continues to move until you release the mouse 
  button (or center your cursor).<br>
  <br>
  The <strong>Absolute</strong> mode, camera movements are directly connected 
  to mouse movements. Click and hold anywhere on the widget square and then drag 
  around, you'll see that the camera moves with your mouse. If you stop moving 
  the mouse, the camera stops moving. Same goes for the forward/backward vertical 
  control.<br>
  </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The <strong>Drag Speed</strong> slider enables you to change the speed/movement 
  in both the Relative and Absolute mode.<br>
  <br>
  If one of your camera views gets lost somewhere where you don't see anything, 
  you may use the &quot;<strong>Reset Cam</strong>&quot; button to reset camera 
  views to their centered defaults.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Fly camera view enables you to fly around the level using the mouse.</strong> 
  Selecting this mode will automatically uncheck the &quot;Follow Selection&quot; 
  option, and switch to the &quot;Rotate Cam&quot; Screen control mode. In the 
  fly mode, click and drag on the 3D view to rotate the camera, and use shift 
  and ctrl (while holding the left mouse button) to go forward and backward, respectively. 
  Holding alt/option will enable you to fly faster. While in the Fly mode, you 
  can select objects by right-clicking, without having to switch to Select Object 
  mode.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Orbit camera view is very useful.</strong> Clicking on it will automatically 
  enable the &quot;Follow Selection&quot; option, since by definition the Orbit 
  view follows the selected object. If you switch from the Orbit to Fly camera 
  view, the Fly cam will inherit the orbit cam position and rotation. To achieve 
  the same effect going from Front,Back, Top, Bottom, Left, Right to Fly camera, 
  hold the shift key.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <br>
  The orbit cam will follow the curently selected object, and enable you to &quot;orbit&quot; 
  around it, and zoom in and out on the selection.<br>
  <br>
  <u><strong><font size="3">Options buttons:</font></strong></u></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/cubes.jpg" width="90" height="20"><br>
  <strong>Cube buttons:</strong> Switches between Perspective/Orthographic projection. 
  The magnifying glasses are only available for zooming in Orthographic projection.<strong><br>
  </strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Magnifiying 
  Glasses:</strong> Used only with Orthographic camera, used to zoom in or out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="images/culling.jpg" width="74" height="20"><br>
  Culling:</strong> Normally, the back of polygon faces may or may not be shown, 
  depending on how the level is drawn. Clicking this checkbox will hide the back 
  of polygon faces. It can be usefully to check this box for levels that have 
  enclosed rooms, like inside the castle. Unfortunately, the process can take 
  a few seconds in some levels. (I'll try to improve performance for this option.)<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/wireframe.jpg" width="93" height="20"> <br>
  <strong>Wireframe:</strong> Shows the level in wireframe mode. Doesn't work 
  using the software renderer.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/collismap.jpg" width="109" height="20"><strong><br>
  </strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Collision 
  Map:</strong> Shows or hide the collision map. The collision map determines 
  what's solid. While some objects, like boxes and some platforms are solid by 
  themselves, some other platforms, particularly in Bowser's course rely on the 
  collision map to be solid. Eventually, I'll add an editor for the collision 
  map, but for now it's only used as a guide. Activating the collision map will 
  automatically set the Wireframe mode, so that the normal level geometry can 
  become transparent. Desactivating the collision map will put the Wireframe mode 
  back to what it was before.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/levelselec.jpg" width="139" height="20"> <br>
  <strong>Activate Level Select:</strong> Activates the Level Select Menu in the 
  ROM. This change is saved automatically when you click on the checkbox.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/selectionboxes.jpg" width="235" height="20"> <br>
  <strong>Selection Boxes:</strong> This is a pop-up menu containing 3 options. 
  &quot;Show all&quot; will display selection boxes for all three 3d objects types, 
  0x24, 0x42 and 0x43 (Red, Blue and Green). &quot;This Command Only&quot; will 
  only show boxes for the currently selected command type, while &quot;Selection 
  only&quot; will show a box only around the selected object(s).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/droptoground.jpg" width="235" height="20"><br>
  <strong>Drop To Ground:</strong> Clicking the button itself will drop the currently 
  selected object to the ground.<br>
  </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Keep 
  On Ground:</strong> Clicking the checkbox will make objects follow ground level 
  as they are being moved.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/followselection.jpg" width="126" height="20"><br>
  <strong>Follow Selection:</strong> Will automatically move the camera to put 
  the current selected object in the center of the 3d view. It's automatically 
  checked when switching to Orbit cam mode, and cannot be used with the Fly cam 
  mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/dragspeed.jpg" width="190" height="20"><br>
  <strong>Drag Speed:</strong> Affects dragging speed for the Object Move/Rotate 
  and Camera widgets, as well as the flying speed.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Renderer:</strong> Displays the current 3d renderer. By default, the 
  renderer will be chosen automatically. Possible values are openGL, directx7_0, 
  directx5_2 and software. On the Mac platform, only openGL and software are available. 
  On Windows, all options are potentially useable, but if you don't have openGL 
  installed, this option will do nothing. Depending on your OS, video-card and 
  drivers, there may be some situations where TT64 will fall back to software. 
  It's not an ideal situation since the software renderer is slower, and doesn't 
  support some shader effects. On Windows 98 and XP, OpenGL seems to give the 
  best results, but that may vary depending on your machine configuration. On 
  Vista, TT64 will more than probably switch to software, and you won't be able 
  to switch to other renderer (you may try though).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Hexadecimal:</strong> When checked, TT64 will display most values using 
  hexadecimal notation. Useful for power-users. Hexadecimal values must be preceded 
  by an &quot;h&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/bgcolor.jpg" width="94" height="40"> <br>
  <strong>BG color palette:</strong> Enables you to switch the background color 
  for the 3d view. Future versions of TT64 will optionally use the original sky 
  texture as a background.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/screencontrols.jpg" width="93" height="20"><br>
  <strong>Screen Controls:</strong> These are to be used with the Fly cam. In 
  &quot;Select Object&quot; mode, clicking on the 3d view will select an object. 
  In &quot;Rotate Mode&quot;, you'll be able to rotate the camera by dragging 
  the cursor around in the 3d view. Note that right-clicking in the &quot;Rotate 
  Camera&quot; mode will enable you to select an object without switching to the 
  other mode. Switching to any other camera mode will put the screen controls 
  in &quot;Select Object&quot; mode, while clicking the &quot;Rotate Camera&quot; 
  button will switch to Fly cam mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><strong><font size="3">Command 
  Menu:</font></strong></u></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/cmdmenu.jpg" width="235" height="87"><br>
  The commands menu, on the top left of the window, contains a list of commands 
  types. Clicking the &quot;Expert&quot; button enables you to see more commands, 
  though most of these expert commands are not editable for now.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commands 0x24,0x42 and 0x43 
  are used to place 3D objects in levels. As for this version, you can only modify 
  already existing objects, you cannot add new objects. These 3D objects are represented 
  using colored wireframe boxes, corresponding to the color of the command, red 
  for 0x24, blue for 0x42 and green for 0x43.<br>
  <br>
  Clicking on the different commands in the menu will load a list of commands, 
  to be displayed in the object menu, just bellow the command menu.<br>
  <br>
  While all these three command types place 3D objects in the level, each of them 
  have particular limitations. 0x24 is the most flexible and extensive command, 
  for example its objects can be rotated around all three axis, while 0x42 objects 
  are restricted to rotation around the Y axis, and only some 0x43 objects can 
  be rotated, and that only around the Y axis. The difference between them will 
  be explained in detail in the Parameter Bar section.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <strong><u><br>
  <font size="3">Object menu:</font></u></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/objmenu.jpg"><br>
  </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The object menu is 
  just bellow the command menu, and will take the color and title of the selected 
  command type. It contains a list of all objects that have this command type, 
  for this particular area of this particular level.<br>
  <br>
  The first number on the left of each object entries in the menu is a sequential 
  number attributed from the order in which they are read in the level script.<br>
  <br>
  with a description label. The two values between { } brackets are the two behavior 
  params values, when applicable. A description for the behavior params is provided 
  when they exist, if not, a numerical value is shown. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clicking on a line will 
  select this particular object. The line will turn yellow and will be underlined. 
  If you hold the shift key you can select multiple objects, even from different 
  command types.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 123/ABC button enables 
  you to toggle between numerical and alphabetical sorting. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><strong><font size="3">Moving 
  and Rotating Objects:</font></strong></u></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 3 types of objects 
  that can be moved and rotated inside a level, 0x24, 0x42 and 0x43 and are shown 
  as red, blue and green boxes respectively.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To move and/or rotate one 
  or more object, you first have to select it. You can either use the Object Menu, 
  or click directly on the 3d view while you are in Select Object mode. Using 
  a right-click should select an object on the 3d view while in Rotate Cam mode. 
  You can hold the shift key to select multiple objects.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/movewidgets.jpg" width="180" height="60"> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Objects can be moved using 
  4 methods:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Using the positioning 
  widget seen uphere. It works much like the camera control widget, but moves 
  objects instead of the camera.<br>
  2. Using the keyboard. Look at the end of this document for a list of relevant 
  key commands.<br>
  3. By dragging objects directly on the 3d view. This only works using the Front,Back, 
  Top, Bottom, Left and Right camera modes.<br>
  4. By clicking on arrow buttons in the parameter bar for x, y, z values, manually 
  entering coordinates or pasting them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Objects can be rotated using 
  3 methods, but note that only 0x24 objects can be rotated on all 3 axis:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Using the rotation widget 
  seen uphere. If you hold shift you'll rotate the object by 45&deg; increments.<br>
  2. Using the keyboard. Look at the end of this document for a list of relevant 
  key commands.<br>
  4. By clicking on rotation buttons in the parameter bar for x, y, z values, 
  manually entering coordinates or pasting them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><strong><font size="3">Changing 
  Object Types:</font></strong></u></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You cannot add objects in 
  TT64 (yet), but you can change objects into another. You can, for example, change 
  a butterfly into a Goomba.<br>
  <br>
  To do that, first select the object you want to change in the object list, or 
  by some other method like clicking on the 3d view.<br>
  By default, a yellow pop-up menu will appear containing a list of available 
  object for this level. Not all objects are available in a level, you are restricted 
  to a particular set, this is a limitation of the game engine. Click on the object 
  in the list, and it will be applied to the current selection.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/popmenu.jpg" width="234" height="146"><br>
  The yellow menu is a contextual menu, that means it's content and use will change 
  depending on which parameter is selected. To make it easier for beginners, the 
  &quot;Object Combo&quot; parameter and its pop-up menu is automatically selected 
  when you select a 0x24 object and when the menu is closed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This little icon: <img src="images/yellowicon.jpg" width="19" height="19"> 
  will turn yellow in the parameter bar below to show you that the current menu 
  pertains to this parameter. As you can see, other parameters have similar icons, 
  clicking on them will open the related yellow menu. Like for the object list, 
  the 123/ABC button enables you to toggle between numerical and alphabetical 
  sorting. The X closes the current menu. To prevent the menu from opening a default 
  parameter each time you select an object, uncheck in &quot;Auto-open default 
  pop-up menu&quot; option in the preferences.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About the 3d objects in 
  SM64: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 3d object is defined 
  by a Model ID and a Behavior number. The Model ID determines how the object 
  look, and the Behavior number determines how it behaves. Manually matching Model 
  ID's with their Behavior would be tedious, so TT64 provides a list of valid 
  Model IDs/Behaviors combinations used in the game. These appear in the Object 
  Combo menu, which is automatically opened by default when you select an 0x24 
  object. Selecting an &quot;Object Combo&quot; will actually set the Model ID 
  and Behavior number accordingly, though you may not see it if you have the Parameter 
  Bar set in &quot;basic&quot; mode. When in expert mode you can create new combinations, 
  though it can be more risky, as some Model ID/Behavior combos can be incompatible 
  and crash the game. 0x42 and 0x43 also provide a parameter that sets both the 
  Model ID and Behavior for an object (called Macro and Special Presets), but 
  these come from hard-coded lists in the ROM so you can't create new combinations.<br>
  <br>
  Model ID zero means that the object is invisible. But the behavior code can 
  sometimes produce an object in the game, even though the Model ID is set to 
  zero. In the Object Combo, Macro Preset and Special Preset yellow menus, objects 
  that have a * in front of their names have a Model ID set to zero. Be careful 
  with some of them, as they can generate objects that will be incompatible with 
  the current level. Warps though, don't generate objects and can be used everywhere.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Parameter Bar:</u></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/parambar24.jpg" width="711" height="100"><br>
  The parameter bar contains parameters and their values for the currently selected 
  command/object. If multiple objects are selected, dashes ( ----) will indicate 
  multiple different values. Parameters are color coded, here's what each color 
  mean.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#0065CF"><strong>Green/Blue:</strong></font> Normal parameters, 
  that have their values stored in ROM.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF0500"><strong>Red:</strong></font> Combo parameters. These are 
  not stored in ROM, but rather represent &quot;combos&quot; or presets for multiple 
  other values, from a list built by the editor. For example, the &quot;Object 
  Combo&quot; parameter represents Model ID/Behavior parameter pairs. Modifying 
  a combo value will affect multiple ROM parameters. To see which ones are affected 
  by the combo, click on the parameter label. If you modify affected parameters 
  (for example the Model ID) and end up creating a new combination, you'll see 
  that the description label shows &quot;Undefined Combo&quot;. By editing this 
  description label and pressing enter, you can add this combination to the editor's 
  list.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#C900FF"><strong>Purple:</strong></font> Like normal parameters, 
  they are values from the ROM. The difference is that they represent combos/presets 
  that are defined by a list found in the ROM. Changing them doesn't affect other 
  parameters in the ROM, but gray parameters, which represent the equivalent Model 
  ID/Behavior for this particular combo will be updated accordingly when a change 
  is made.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#444444"><strong>Gray:</strong></font> These parameters are not 
  in the ROM as is, and can not be modified. They're simply there to indicate 
  the signification of a particular purple parameter preset.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#FF5700"><strong>Orange:</strong></font> The orange parameters 
  are called &quot;Behavior Parameters&quot;. They have a different meaning depending 
  on the current behavior. For example, one behavior param can be used to determine 
  the content of a [!] box, or the difficulty of an enemy. For warps, one of the 
  behavior parameter will determine which warp destination will be used.<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/parambuttons.jpg" width="78" height="100"><br>
  <strong>Basic/Expert:</strong> In basic mode, the parameter bar displays a minimum 
  of parameters, hiding some of them. The expert mode enables you to see all parameters. 
  <br>
  <strong>ROM address:</strong> Shows the actual location of the current command 
  in the ROM. For experts, if you type/paste an address in this text field then 
  press return/enter, TT64 will attempt to find the object from this location, 
  and select it.<br>
  <strong>Copy Params:</strong> This will copy the currently selected params to 
  an internal clipboard. You can select multiple params by using the shift key. 
  Also, when you click a combo value, all related params are automatically selected.<br>
  <strong>Paste Params:</strong> Use to paste previously copied params. You don't 
  have to select the params, they'll be automatically pasted where they belong.<br>
  <strong>Copy Hex Data:</strong> For experts, will copy the current command in 
  hexadecimal form in the OS clipboard, enabling you to use it in an hex editor 
  for example.<br>
  Revert Object: Reverts the selected object(s) to the previously saved state.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u><strong>Modifiying Description 
  Labels :</strong></u></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some parameters show a description 
  label such as &quot;Level Exit Recovering Life&quot; in the example below. These 
  can be edited by clicking them while holding the alt or option key.<br>
  When hitting return, or deselecting the label text field by clicking elsewhere, 
  the modified label will be saved in one of these three files: objects_labels.txt, 
  bparams_labels.txt and main_labels.txt, depending on the label type. These files 
  can be found in the program's folder. If you know what you're doing, you can 
  also edit them using a text editor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This feature can be useful 
  if you create an &quot;Undefined Combo&quot; which happens when you create a 
  new Model ID/Behavior combination.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that these files are 
  replaced by default ones if you download a new version of TT64, so if you add 
  a lot of new descriptions, you might want to backup the 3 modified label files 
  from the old version and copy them in the new version's folder. If you add a 
  lot of interesting new combos and want me to integrate them in the default files 
  for subsequent releases, just send me the objects_labels.txt, bparams_labels.txt

  <strong><u><font color="#0065CF">0x24 - 3D objects.</font></u></strong><br>
  This 3d object command type is the most flexible, as it provides full control 
  over position, rotation on all 3 axis, along with individual model and behavior 
  selection.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/parambar24.jpg" width="711" height="100"><br>
  <br>
  <strong>&#8226;Act:</strong> This parameter indicates in which &quot;act&quot; 
  (Star Goal) this particular object will appear. Click the little stars to turn 
  on or off a particular act. Note that the sixth star has another meaning which 
  I haven't found yet.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Object Combo:</strong> This combo will affect Model ID/Behavior 
  parameter pairs. Using it will ensure that a particular Model has the right 
  Behavior. <strong>Clicking on the little menu icon will present you with a yellow 
  menu list of possible combos for this particular level.</strong> Not all objects 
  are available in each level. TT64 will try to provide you with a list containing 
  only those that can be used in the current level. There are instances though 
  where an object might crash the game when played, even if it's part of the list.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Model ID (Expert mode only):</strong> the Model ID value represents 
  which polygon object is displayed in the game. A value of zero means an invisible 
  object. Some objects rely on the behavior code to display a polygon object, 
  and will display something in the game even though they have a value of zero. 
  A pop-up menu is available containing valid values for this particular level. 
  Again, not all objects are available to each level. Available IDs are defined 
  by 0x22 commands, which can be viewed and edited when the Commands: Expert mode 
  is activated.<strong> Editing the Model ID parameter is not recommended unless 
  you're an adventurous hacker, since the Behav value must be compatible with 
  this particular Model ID.</strong> Using the Object Combo menu is a safer bet 
  since it provides valid Model ID/Behav combinations.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Behav (Expert mode only):</strong> This value represents how 
  the object moves, react and behaves, including how animated characters body 
  parts move. Many behaviors are meant to be used with a particular Model, assigning 
  the Goomba behavior to a Koopa turtle for example, will have weird results. 
  The Behav pop-up menu will provide a list of all possible behaviors, even some 
  that may crash the game if used in a particular level or with a particular Model. 
  Again, only edit if you know what you're doing, and use the Object Combo menu 
  instead if you want to ensure the validity of the Model/Behav combination.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;B. Param 1 &amp; 2:</strong> Just after Behav (or after Object 
  Combo if in Basic mode), you'll find two orange parameters that are usually 
  labeled&quot;B. Param&quot;. These are behavior params. Their meaning changes 
  depending on the current Behav value. TT64 includes custom labels and menus 
  for some behavior params. For example, for the &quot;Walking Goomba&quot; behavior, 
  the second B. Param will be labeled &quot;Size&quot; and the pop-up menu will 
  provide you with valid values, for &quot;Micro&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot; and 
  &quot;Giant&quot; sizes. For warps, the label will be &quot;Warp ID&quot;, and 
  the pop-up menu will provide a dynamic list of possible warp destinations for 
  the current level. For objects that include a dialog, the description label, 
  and menu will correspond to original dialog text (for example, for Toad, or 
  a wooden post sign). Note that in this version of TT64, modified dialog text 
  won't appear in descriptions and menus.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;X,Y,Z, X rot, Y rot and Z rot:</strong> These are simply position 
  and rotation values for the current object. For position you can use the little 
  up/down arrows to modify the value, or enter an arbitrary value, or use the 
  Object Move widget, keyboard controls or drag the object on the screen. For 
  the rotation value, you can use the little circular rotation widget, or the 
  Object Rotate widget. Holding shift will restrict rotation to 45&deg; angles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#0065CF"><u>0x42 
  - Macro 3d objects.</u></font></strong><br>
  This 3d object command type is more limited than the 0x24 command, as it's restricted 
  to a list of &quot;Macro Presets&quot; that defined which model and behavior 
  is used. Also, rotation is only possible around the Y axis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/images/TT64Params0x42.jpg" width="710" height="99"><br>
  <br>
  <strong>&#8226;Macro Preset:</strong> This value represents a Model/Behav/B. 
  Params combination, as defined by the game itself. Unlike the 0x24 command's 
  Object Combo, this is an actual value in the ROM that can range from 0 to 511, 
  and the related Model/Behav parameters cannot be modified. It provides a pop-up 
  menu with objects that are available for this level.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;B. Param 1 &amp; 2 (orange):</strong> Similar to the Behavior 
  parameters in 0x24 commands, the difference here is that the orange parameters 
  will override those defined by this particular Macro Preset value, if they're 
  not equal to zero.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Y rot:</strong> Just like the 0x24 command, the main difference 
  here is that rotation in 0x42 commands is only possible around the Y axis.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Model ID/Behav/B. Params (gray):</strong> These are for display 
  purposes only, they are linked to the current Macro Preset value. You can though, 
  copy these parameters and paste them in a 0x24 command, for which these parameters 
  are modifiable. Gray B. Params are overridden by their orange counterparts if 
  the latter aren't equal to zero.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#0065CF"><u>0x43 
  - Special 3d objects.</u></font></strong><br>
  This is the most limited 3d object command type, and the most complicated to 
  deal with. It can vary in length, some parameters don't exist in certain instance, 
  that depend on the &quot;Special Preset&quot; value. The game will expect the 
  command to be a certain length depending on this value.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/images/TT64Params0x43.jpg" width="710" height="100"></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8226;Length:</strong> 
  Indicates the length of this particular command. Dependent on the &quot;Special 
  Preset&quot; value. Some commands are 8 bytes long, some 10 or 12 bytes.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Special Preset:</strong> Similar to the Macro Preset parameter 
  of 0x42 commands, but it uses a different preset list in the ROM, with values 
  ranging from 0 to 255. You'll find that the pop-up menu often provide only a 
  few choices, since it's limited to values used by commands of the same size.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;B. Param 1 &amp; 2 (orange):</strong> These are not always present 
  in 0x43 commands. Similar to the Behavior parameters in 0x24 commands, the difference 
  here is that the orange parameters will override those defined by this particular 
  Macro Preset value, if they're not equal to zero.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Y rot:</strong> Just like the 0x42 command, but Y rotation is 
  not present for some object commands.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Model ID/Behav/B. Params (gray):</strong> These are for display 
  purposes only, they are linked to the current Special Preset value. You can 
  though, copy these parameters and paste them in a 0x24 command, for which these 
  parameters are modifiable. Gray B. Params are overridden by their orange counterparts 
  if the latter exist and aren't equal to zero. <br>

  <strong>&#8226;Music Track:</strong> The only parameter for this command, provides 
  a pop-up menu containing all tracks.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><u><font color="#0065CF">0x26 - Warps.</font></u></strong><br>
  Sets how warps are connected together. The warp themselves are put in levels 
  using 0x24 commands that have a warp behavior, and use a Warp ID value that 
  refers to a particular 0x26 command.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/TT64Params0x26.jpg" width="710" height="49"></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>&#8226;Warp ID:</strong> 
  This is the value that will be referred by 0x24 warp objects, be careful if 
  you edit those, make sure that all 0x24 commands referring to this particular 
  warp command are modified accordingly. Keep in mind that commands in other levels 
  can refer to this particular warp connection. Value -15 is used when Mario dies, 
  and -16 when he completes a level.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Destination Level:</strong> Sets the destination level for this 
  particular warp.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Destination Area:</strong> Sets the destination area for this

  - Warps (Paintings).</u></font></strong><br>
  These only exist inside the castle. Sets the destination for painting and level 
  warps. Interesting to note is that for paintings, there are 3 possible destinations, 
  which are linked to the horizontal position of Mario when he enters the painting. 
  If he enters the painting on the left side, the first warp destination is used. 
  If he enters the middle part, the second warp is used, and the third for the 
  right side. In the original game, they're set to the same value, but you can 
  set them differently if you want. Keep in mind that painting level exits are 
  normal warps placed using 0x24 and 0x26 commands, and unless you change their 
  value in the level itself, Mario will exit the level through the original painting.</font></p>

  particular painting warp.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Destination Area:</strong> Sets the destination area for this

  <strong>0x22 - Geometry Layout Pointer. (Expert Mode only)</strong></u></font><br>
  This command type defines which polygon object will be displayed when a particular 
  Model ID is used in a level. The Geometry Layout data is a particular set of 
  commands defining where and how polygons are assembled to make a model. The 
  0x22 command points to this data.</font></p>

  <strong>&#8226;Set Model ID:</strong> This is the value that's referred by 0x24 
  commands, and indirectly by 0x42 and 0x43 commands. I don't recommend editing 
  this value, as many commands may rely on this particular value to exist.<br>
  <strong>&#8226;Geo Layout Combo:</strong> This is a combo value for Bank IDs/Geo 
  Layout Pairs. It's pop-up menu provides a list of valid models that can be used 
  in this particular level. The available models are limited to those that are 
  part of a data bank loaded in memory by the game using the 0x17/0x18/0x1A commands. 
  Note that if you are editing a shared 0x22 command (one that has an &quot;s&quot;), 
  changes will affect other levels too, and the pop-up menu will restrict your 
  choices to models that can be used in all levels sharing this command.<br>
  <strong>&#8226; Bank ID:</strong> This is the bank number where the Geometry

  <strong><font color="#0065CF"><u>0x21 - Polygon ID and Pointer. (Expert Mode

  It's similar to the 0x22 command, in the sense that a 0x24 command can refer 
  to this command with it's Model ID parameter. The difference is that the 0x21 
  command points to polygon data directly instead of using a Geometry Layout script. 
  Only a few objects use this. Not editable in this version of TT64.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/TT64Params0x17.jpg" width="710" height="24"></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These essentially define 
  which object bank will be available for this particular level. In a Bowser battle 
  level for example, the Banks containing its polygons and geometry layout data 
  will be loaded in memory. Since the Bowser banks are not loaded in other levels, 
  you cannot put Bowser in other levels. TT64 will try to ensure that only objects 
  from available banks are provided in menus. These will be eventually editable 
  in future versions of TT64, but the process is not as simple as you might think. 
  Note that many of these 0x17 commands are 0x18 commands in the original, unextended 
  ROM. The 0x18 command loads compressed MIO0 data. The ROM extender decompresses 
  this data and put the uncompressed version at the end of the ROM, changing the

  Load textures from ROM:</strong> When opening a ROM, will load custom textures 
  directly from the ROM, instead of using the included original textures. This 
  will slow loading individual levels the first time you load them in memory.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><strong>Auto-Save 
  level changes:</strong> When this option is checked, every change made to level 
  data will be automatically saved.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Alternate Orbit 
  cam widget:</strong> Swap the vertical rotation and zooming functions of the 
  Move Cam widget when in Orbit cam mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Start with last 
  opened level:</strong> Next time you start TT64, it will open the last level 
  you were working on.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Default level:</strong> To set the level that's loaded when opening 
  a ROM. Overriden by the &quot;Start with last opened level&quot; option if checked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Extra info in object 
  lists:</strong> Will add two things to each item in the object list, in between 
  the object number and its description.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First is a single letter 
  to the right tells you if the object is either i=internal, s=shared or x=external.<br>
  <br>
  Internal objects means that they are part of the level script, and exclusive 
  to this level. Shared objects are not part of the main level script, and are 
  used by multiple levels, and that means that changing it will affect these levels 
  too. External objects are also not part of this level's script, but they're 
  only used by that level. The next number is one of the object's parameter, this 
  can vary depending on the command type. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Auto-open default 
  pop-up menu:</strong> On by default, will make TT64 automatically open a default 
  pop-up menu when you select an object and the yellow menu is closed. Uncheck 
  to have the pop-up menu only appear when you click on a <img src="images/yellowicon.jpg" width="19" height="19"> 
  icon.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Skip checksum:</strong> 
  If you're an expert hacker and have modified the checksum of the ROM after it 
  was extended, the ROM will fail to open unless this option is checked.</font></p>

<p><font color="#002C5A" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#8226;A very bad 
  bug has been fixed, going to the texture editor and back would corrupt the ROM, 
  and cause it to crash when run in an emulator.<br>
  &#8226;The issue had something to do with saving Mario's size, which is done 
  automatically when quitting the texture editor.<br>
  &#8226;To fix a crashing ROM, open it with TT64, go to the texture editor, and 
  then back to the level editor</font><font color="#002C5A" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">.<br>
  &#8226;Opening a correctly extended ROM on a Japanese or other asian unicode

<p><font color="#002C5A" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#8226;Some of the 
  bundled default textures were corrupted and were causing some display problems, 
  this has been corrected.<br>
  &#8226;Fixed some problems when editing 0x22 commands.<br>
  &#8226;Loading ROMs containing 0x22 pointing to non-existant banks shouldn't 
  cause a script error anymore.<br>
  &#8226;Fixed a potential bug where in some context the box sizes wouldn't match 
  the objects with some modified ROMs.<br>

  Fixes in 0.5.5b:</font></strong></u></font></p>
<p><font color="#002C5A" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&#8226;Fixed a bug where putting a 0x42 object that had a Macro Preset value 
  of &quot;1E&quot; would cause all subsequent objects to become invisible and 
  in-editable when reloading the ROM.<br>
  &#8226;Some previously missing 0x42 objects in Bowser course 3 are now visible 
  and editable. (Related to the bug above).<br>
  &#8226;Previous versions of TT64 would only show you Object Combos and Behaviors 
  used in the ROM that was loaded. That means that if you were to change the behavior 
  that was only used by a single object in the game, the behavior wouldn't appear 
  in the menu list the next time you'd load the ROM since it wasn't used by this 
  ROM.<br>
  &#8226;TT64 0.5.5b will list all Behaviors and Object Combos from the original 
  game even though the loaded ROM doesn't use them.<br>
  &#8226;Changing the text of a parameter label wont cause the yellow pop-up menu 
  to switch to the parameter.<br>
  &#8226;Camera and move controls are now disabled when not in 0x24, 0x42 or 0x43 
  object mode, as they were supposed to be.<br>
  &#8226;Yellow pop-up menu should now update correctly when pasting params.<br>
  &#8226;Pasting params should not cause script errors anymore, as it did in some 
  contexts.<br>
  &#8226;Editing 0x22 commands now updates the objects in the 3d view and object 
  lists. <br>
  &#8226;Yellow pop-up menu for Destination Warp ID will update correctly while 
  changing the destination level to reflect which warps are available there.<br>
  &#8226;Maximizing before the ROM is first loaded shouldn't cause an error anymore.<br>
  &#8226;Unnamed Behavior params won't show as &quot;B. Param: B. Param&quot; 
  in the pop-up menu header.<br>
  &#8226;Yellow pop-up menu should now update correctly when reverting objects.<br>
  &#8226;Rotating in &quot;relative&quot; mode would cause a script error. Rotation 
  with the widget is now only done in absolute mode. The &quot;relative&quot; 
  and &quot;absolute&quot; options will only affect the move object widget.<br>
  &#8226;Reverting a 0x43 object that has a rotation parameter should now revert 
  the rotation value, as expected.<br>
  &#8226;Reverting commands other than 0x24, 0x42 and 0x43 will only revert commands 
  of the current command type. <br>
  &#8226;Sorting in the yellow pop-menu would fail in some context. It should 
  now work correctly.<br>
  &#8226;When changing a coordinate value manually, or when pasting coordinates, 
  the camera should now follow the object as expected, when in Orbit Camera mode 
  or when the &quot;Follow Selection&quot; option is checked.<br>
  &#8226;In some cases, every item in the yellow pop-menu would become underlined. 
  This shouldn't happen in this version.<br>
  &#8226;Exporting grayscale textures would cause the alpha mask to get inverted, 
  and the gray depth would be severely reduced. This is fixed.<br>
  &#8226;The Export To Folder button in the Texture Importer/Exporter should now 
  work as expected.<br>
  &#8226;Mario Colors interface had a few glitches that are now fixed.</font></p>

  &#8226;The pop-up menu won't close when opening another menu.<br>
  &#8226;Fixed a bug where the 3d view would get incorrectly sized if the window 
  was resized when the level menu was open.<br>
  &#8226;No more script errors when clicking on the empty part of the area selector.<br>
  &#8226;When pasting params, the object list and pop-up menu are now correctly
